# HealthPredict-AI
#Project Overview

The Disease Prediction project is a machine learning-based application designed to provide early and accurate predictions of various diseases based on patient symptoms and medical data. This system aims to assist healthcare professionals by analyzing patient information and predicting potential illnesses, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy and enabling timely treatment. By integrating advanced machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing techniques, and intuitive interfaces, this project offers an effective tool for healthcare diagnostics and decision support.

#Objectives

Develop predictive models to identify diseases from patient symptoms using machine learning.
Improve the accuracy of disease diagnosis to support healthcare professionals.
Provide a user-friendly interface for easy input of symptoms and visualization of predictions.
Enable continuous improvement of the model through the integration of new data.
Ensure data privacy and security conforming to industry standards.

#Key Features

Multiple Disease Detection: Ability to predict several diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, liver disease, and more.
Robust Machine Learning Models: Uses algorithms like Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Logistic Regression for reliable predictions.
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, categorical data encoding, and class imbalance using methods like oversampling.
User Interface: Simple and interactive UI for healthcare practitioners to input symptoms and obtain predictions.
Model Evaluation: Implements performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix visualization.
Extensible Design: Modular architecture allowing easy addition of new diseases and models.
